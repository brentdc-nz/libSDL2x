# libSDL2x

This is a port of SDL 2.0.10 to the orignal Xbox.

The port has been tested with SDL2 samples (lazyfoo.net) as well as my port of DevilutionX

### SDL2 Todo:
- Separate alpha blend.
- YUV texture support (mostly used for video playback?).
- Need to get TextInput working.
- No onscreen keyboard.
- Missing SDL hidapi subsystem (is this likely to be used for ports to Xbox tho?).

### Working SDL2 Addons
- SDL2 Mixer

### Notes:

Special thanks to AsayuGit the SDL2 Mixer addon port and fixes, as well as Lantus/MVG and Hyper_Eye, for their work on the SDL 1.2 port.
